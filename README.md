# Dots And Boxes React Game

**Repository Description:**

Welcome to the repository for the Square-Dot Game, an interactive digital recreation of the timeless strategy game that has delighted generations. Designed to be both captivating and challenging, this game will test your foresight, strategy, and ability to outmaneuver your opponent.

**Game Introduction:**
The Square-Dot Game, also known as Dots and Boxes, involves two players who take turns to connect adjacent dots on a grid with vertical and horizontal lines. The objective is to complete more squares than your opponent. As each player adds a line, the opportunities to complete squares increase, and strategic planning becomes crucial.

**Rules of the Game:**
1. The game is played on a grid of dots.
2. Players take turns to draw a single line (either horizontal or vertical) between two unjoined adjacent dots.
3. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns one point and takes another turn.
4. The boxes completed by a player are marked with their specific color or initials.
5. The game ends when all the boxes have been completed.
6. The winner is the player with the most completed boxes.

**Technologies Used:**
- **React:** A flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React allows us to create reusable UI components and manage the game's dynamic state changes with virtual DOM for optimal performance.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JS apps, Redux maintains the state of the entire application in a single immutable state tree, enabling easy tracking of changes over time, undo/redo features, and more.
- **Sass Modules:** An extension of CSS, Sass lets us use variables, nested rules, mixins, and more, all in a concise and organized manner. It makes writing CSS faster and more efficient, allowing for sophisticated theming and styling of the game environment.

We have combined these powerful technologies to ensure that our rendition of the Square-Dot Game not only captures the strategic depth of the original but also enhances it with a fluid, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface, ready to enjoy on your preferred device.
